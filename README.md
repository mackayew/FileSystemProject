# FileSystemProject


I wrote this program for a final assignment in a programming class (April 2020) in order to demonstrate my understanding of both Python and SQL (using the sqlite3 module) and show how they can be used together in a program.
This program acts like a text-based File Explorer in that you can create, edit, move, and delete files and folders, however these objects are merely placeholders. No actual files or folders are created on the system aside from the database file created when the program is first run, and two excel spreadsheets used to keep track of objects that have been created after the program is closed.
Python elements used in this program include functions, classes, exceptions, iterations, and more.
SQL elements used in this program include CREATE, SELECT, and UPDATE statements.
